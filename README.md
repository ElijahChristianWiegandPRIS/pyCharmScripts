# Python Excel Analysis Scripts

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains Python scripts specifically created for analyzing Excel spreadsheets and performing data-related tasks where Python proves to be the more efficient or powerful tool compared to manual Excel work or other software.

## 🧠 Why Python?

While Excel is great for many day-to-day tasks, certain operations—like large-scale data transformations, automation, or complex analytics—are better handled with Python. This repo is where those solutions live.

## 📂 What's Inside

You'll find scripts for:
- Automating repetitive Excel tasks
- Cleaning and transforming data
- Generating reports or summaries
- Performing calculations or visualizations that are cumbersome in Excel

## 👥 Team Visibility

This repository serves as a central location for the team to:
- Understand where advanced Excel-related scripts are stored
- Reuse or adapt existing solutions
- Contribute improvements or new scripts
If you're ever wondering *"Where did that Python script go that analyzes Excel files?"* — this is the place.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run these scripts, you'll need:
- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
